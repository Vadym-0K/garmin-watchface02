## Bluetooth Mesh

Bluetooth mesh is a protocol that was released in 2017 by the Bluetooth SIG. Since that time, it has slowly started to gain traction for its many-to-many connection capabilities, enhanced range, and security features. The protocol is getting more attention with the big silicon manufacturers, and every week sees the release of new Bluetooth mesh IoT devices. Because this protocol is quickly rising in popularity, the team here at Garmin thought that it would be an interesting challenge to see if the Bluetooth mesh protocol could be supported on Connect IQ devices using the brand new BluetoothLowEnergy APIs. Out of this concept came two projects - a Bluetooth mesh library and an example application using the library.
